# What's Pitaya
From Wikipedia:
> ~~A pitaya /pᵻˈtaɪ.ə/ or pitahaya /ˌpɪtəˈhaɪ.ə/ is the fruit of several cactus species indigenous to the Americas.~~

**Pitaya** is a generalized tool aimed at lexical analysis and syntax analysis.

It's the curriculum project for my course *Compiler Principles*.

# Project spec
Pitaya mainly consists of three modules:

1. General
  - This module contains components that can be reused by both lexical analyzer and syntax analyzer.
2. LA
  - This module is responsible for lexical analysis.
3. SA
  - This module is responsible for syntax analysis.

Below is the file structure of this project:
```

## Building
Pitaya has been developed with [Visual Studio 2015]
(https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-community-vs.aspx),
the `build` folder contains the solution file and all project files respectively.

All three modules mentioned above will be built into static library.
If the project was built correctly, `lib` folder should contain these files:
- `pitaya.lib`
- `pitaya_la.lib`
- `pitaya_sa.lib`

## Dependencies
`external` folder contains all the external library this project depends on.

Pitaya only uses [boost 1.60.0](http://www.boost.org/) for now.

**Note** The sub-project `Test` produces an executable which uses boost's [program options]
(http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_60_0/doc/html/program_options.html) thus needs the
corresponding static library (`libboost_program_options-vc140-mt-gd-1_60.lib` for debug and
`libboost_program_options-vc140-mt-1_60.lib` for release).

You should download **boost 1.60.0** and run `bootstrap.bat`.
Upon finishing, open your terminal and execute:
```
$ b2 --build-dir=[some directory] --build-type=complete msvc stage link=static
```
Go ahead to play ~~Civ5~~, win, switch to the output folder, copy the `.lib` to `lib` folder, done.:wink:

## Documentation
`doc` folder contains the documentation generated by [Doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/)
in the format of html.
